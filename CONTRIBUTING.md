# Contributing to This .NET Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Whether you're fixing a bug,
improving documentation, or proposing a new feature, your contributions
help strengthen the project and the broader .NET ecosystem.

This guide explains how to work with the codebase, follow our conventions,
and collaborate effectively.

## 🧭 Ways to Contribute

### 1. Report Issues
Use the **Issues** tab to report:
- Bugs  
- Performance regressions  
- API design concerns  
- Feature requests  
- Documentation improvements  

When reporting a bug:
- Include your .NET SDK/runtime version (`dotnet --info`)  
- Provide clear reproduction steps  
- Share expected vs. actual behavior  
- Add stack traces or minimal repro code when possible  

---

## 🛠 Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (LTS or STS version used by the project)  
- An IDE or editor such as Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider  
- Git  

### Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

### Project Structure (example)
```
/src            → main libraries or application code  
/tests          → unit and integration tests  
/samples        → usage examples  
/tools          → build, CI, or code-generation utilities  
```

## Testing Guidelines

We take test coverage and reliability seriously.

- Use **xUnit**.
- Follow the Arrange–Act–Assert pattern  
- Prefer deterministic tests—avoid time‑dependent or environment‑dependent behavior  
- Add tests for:
  - New features  
  - Bug fixes  
  - Edge cases  
  - Public API changes  

Run the full test suite before submitting a PR:
```cmd
dotnet test
```

## Coding Standards

### Style
- Follow the project’s `.editorconfig`  
- Use `dotnet format` to apply consistent formatting  
- Prefer modern C# features when they improve clarity (e.g., pattern matching, `using` declarations, `Span<T>` when appropriate)  
- Keep public APIs clean, predictable, and well‑documented  

### Documentation
- Use XML documentation comments for public APIs  
- Update `/docs` or `/README.md` when behavior changes  
- Include examples when adding new features  

### Performance
If your change affects performance:
- Include benchmarks using **BenchmarkDotNet**  
- Avoid unnecessary allocations  
- Consider async/await best practices  
- Validate behavior across different runtimes (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS) if relevant
